              </div>
              <p><a href="https://www.somosawaq.org/">Awaq ONGD</a> began working on the creation of <span class="fill-blue">Awaq Campus Internship website</span>, a platform offering hands-on internship and tourism experiences focused on biomonitoring in biological stations across Latin America. When I joined the team in October 2023, the initial UX research had already been completed, and a brand manual was in place.</p>
              <p>The general goal was to design the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) from scratch, using research insights, the information and main features requested by the client and following the brand guidelines to create a user-friendly, engaging, and consistent platform.</p>

              </div>
              <p>I joined the Awaq Campus Internship project as the main designer during the MVP phase, when the initial UX research had already been completed and a brand manual was in place. I was responsible for the entire UI design and prototyping process, ensuring that the experience was user-friendly, engaging, and aligned with the brand identity. I worked alongside developers and stakeholders to bring the platform to life. 
              </p>
              <p class="pb-0 mb-0">I grew significantly throughout this project, both in my design skills and in collaborating within a cross-functional team. Some of the key achievements during this time include:
              </p>
              <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><strong>Designed the full UI for the MVP.</strong> Created clean, functional layouts and high-fidelity prototype.</li>
                <li><strong>Established a design system</strong> to support consistency and collaboration across teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Built interactive prototypes.</strong> Used to demonstrate the platform's functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Applied and maintained the brand manual.</strong> Ensured visual consistency throughout the interface in line with established branding.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Improved usability across the platform</strong> by following best practices and conducting internal reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Supported ongoing improvements.</strong> After the MVP was finished, the platform continued to evolve based on client feedback and emerging needs.</li>

                  </p>
                  <p>The structure of the site was planned to be clear and easy to follow. Internships, destinations, biological stations, and user profiles are organized in a way that helps users complete their bookings without confusion. Additional sections like the help page, company info, and admin panels support both users and the team behind the platform.</p>

On each country's page, available internships are listed, as well as on the biological station pages. Calls to action (CTAs) are placed throughout the site to encourage users to complete their reservation. In the internship page, users can see a list of internships, select one to reserve, or access detailed information about each one. </p></p>

              </div>
              <p>AWAQ Campus Internship homepage was carefully designed to clearly communicate the program's mission, attract users and encourage them to reserve an internship. It needed to match ACI's existing branding while telling a fresh, modern, and visually attractive story, making sure the design aligned with the program's mission. To enhance the visual appeal, illustrations from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/author/stories">storyset on Freepik</a> were used, as they were recommended in the branding manual and helped bring the narrative to life. Throughout the process, the client requested that specific sections be emphasized. These key areas were highlighted in the design to align with the client's vision.
              </p>
              <p>The layout and visuals were carefully crafted to showcase the benefits of participating in the program. Strategic calls to action (CTAs) were placed throughout the page to facilitate internship reservations. Finally, the design was updated to reflect Awaq's achievement of Special Advisory Status at ECOSOC, further enhancing the program's credibility and motivating users to get involved.</p>

              <p>Awaq Campus Internship (ACI) first MVP was presented at the International Congress of Environmental Organizations, held at Universidad Autónoma de Manizales, Colombia. The platform was showcased alongside institutions such as UAM, EAN, Tecnológico de Monterrey, and SENA’s Coffee Training Center. This space allowed the team to present the project’s core functionalities, gather feedback from academic and environmental leaders, and explore potential collaborations to support the platform’s growth.
