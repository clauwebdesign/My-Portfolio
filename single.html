                <h2>Project overview</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Awaq ONGD began working on the creation of Awaq Campus Internship website, a platform offering hands-on internship and tourism experiences focused on biomonitoring in biological stations across Latin America. When I joined the team in October 2023, the initial UX research had already been completed, and a brand manual was in place.</p>
              <p>The general goal was to design the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) from scratch, using research insights, the information and main features requested by the client and following the brand guidelines to create a user-friendly, engaging, and consistent platform.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
              </div>
              <p>I joined the Awaq Campus Internship project as the main designer during the MVP phase, when the initial UX research had already been completed and a brand manual was in place. I was responsible for the entire UI design and prototyping process, ensuring that the experience was user-friendly, engaging, and aligned with the brand identity. I worked alongside developers and stakeholders to bring the platform to life. 
              </p>
              <p class="pb-0 mb-0">I grew significantly throughout this project, both in my design skills and in collaborating within a cross-functional team. Some of the key achievements during this time include:
              </p>
              <ul class="custom-list">
                <li><strong>Designed the full UI for the MVP.</strong> Created clean, functional layouts and high-fidelity screens based on research findings and user needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Established a design system</strong> Helped the Engineering, Product and Design teams understand the reasoning behind component choices and maintain design consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Built interactive prototypes.</strong> Used to demonstrate the platform's functionality during client presentations and internal reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Applied and maintained the brand manual.</strong> Ensured visual consistency throughout the interface in line with established branding.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Improved usability across the platform.</strong> Although formal usability testing was not possible due to limited resources, I focused on usability best practices and conducted internal reviews to identify and address key usability issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Supported ongoing improvements.</strong> After the MVP was finished, the platform continued to evolve through updates based on client feedback and emerging needs.</li>

                <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                <p>I created low-fidelity wireframes that went through multiple rounds of client review, helping to identify improvements early in the process. This approach streamlined the design workflow, saving time during prototyping and ensuring alignment with client expectations before moving into visual design.</p>

                <h3>Interactive reservations</h3>
                <p>The interactive reservation experience went through several iterations with the client and teams. Initially, a search engine was considered, but the complexity of the implementation and the limited development resources led to the implementation of a dynamic reservation page, accessible from different sections of the website. That offered a dynamic and integrated booking experience.</p>

                <p>These supporting pages provided contextual information and also allowed users to make reservations directly from each of them, as the corresponding internships were always listed along with clear calls to action that redirected users to the reservation flow.</p>
                  <p>Due to the client’s request, many text elements were implemented as placeholders, since the content would later be populated dynamically from the backend. The design prioritized a scalable structure, making it possible to easily add new biological stations, countries, and internships as the platform grew.</p>

                <h2>A Homepage Designed to Make an Impact</h2>
              </div>
              <p>The AWAQ Campus Internship homepage was carefully designed to clearly communicate the program's mission, attract users and encourage them to reserve an internship.</p>
              <p>The website was designed with a fresh, modern, and visually attractive style to connect with a wide range of users. It needed to match ACI's existing branding while telling a clear story throughout the user experience, making sure the design aligned with the program's mission. To enhance the visual appeal, illustrations from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/author/stories">storyset on Freepik</a> were used, as they fit well with the branding and helped bring the narrative to life.</p>
              <p>Throughout the process, the client requested that specific sections be emphasized, as they were considered crucial to the program's objectives. These key areas were highlighted in the design to align with the client's vision.
              </p>
              <p>The layout and visuals were carefully crafted to showcase the benefits of participating in the program while maintaining clarity and simplicity. Strategic calls to action (CTAs) were placed throughout the page to encourage user engagement and facilitate internship reservations. Finally, the design was updated to reflect Awaq's achievement of Special Advisory Status at ECOSOC, further enhancing the program's credibility and motivating users to get involved.</p>
