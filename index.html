              </div>
              <p>I joined the Awaq Campus Internship project as the main designer during the MVP phase, when the initial UX research had already been completed and a brand manual was in place. I was responsible for the entire UI design and prototyping process, ensuring that the experience was user-friendly, engaging, and aligned with the brand identity. I worked alongside developers and stakeholders to bring the platform to life. 
              </p>
              <p class="pb-0 mb-0">I grew significantly throughout this project, both in my design skills and in collaborating within a cross-functional team. Some of the key achievements during this time include:

              <p>The website was built with scalability in mind. Every element was designed to be dynamically managed through the database, which required close coordination with the development and product teams to define the necessary components. Since the content would later be populated dynamically from the backend, due to the client’s request, many text elements were implemented as placeholders. </p>

                <h4>Destinations Page</h4>
                <p>The Destinations page was designed to present each country in a visually engaging and informative way. As a reference, Colombia was created as the first destination to illustrate the structure and visual direction of this page. Like the rest of the site, all content elements were intended to be interactive and dynamically populated from the backend.</p>
                <p>From each destination page, users can access general information about the country, explore its biological stations, and view available internships. The design allows users to make internship reservations directly from this section.</p>

                </p>
                <p>An interactive submenu organizes content into key areas such as Mission, Geographical Location, Activities, Environmental and Social Impact, and Station Director. Each section contains different content, including videos, maps for location reference, and downloadable documentation.</p>

                <h3>A Homepage Designed to Make an Impact</h3>
              </div>
              <p>AWAQ Campus Internship homepage was carefully designed to clearly communicate the program's mission, attract users and encourage them to reserve an internship.</p>
              <p>The website was designed with a fresh, modern, and visually attractive style to connect with a wide range of users. It needed to match ACI's existing branding while telling a clear story throughout the user experience, making sure the design aligned with the program's mission. To enhance the visual appeal, illustrations from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/author/stories">storyset on Freepik</a> were used, as they fit well with the branding and helped bring the narrative to life.</p>
              <p>Throughout the process, the client requested that specific sections be emphasized, as they were considered crucial to the program's objectives. These key areas were highlighted in the design to align with the client's vision.
              </p>
              <p>The layout and visuals were carefully crafted to showcase the benefits of participating in the program while maintaining clarity and simplicity. Strategic calls to action (CTAs) were placed throughout the page to encourage user engagement and facilitate internship reservations. Finally, the design was updated to reflect Awaq's achievement of Special Advisory Status at ECOSOC, further enhancing the program's credibility and motivating users to get involved.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Awaq Campus Internship (ACI) first MVP was presented at the International Congress of Environmental Organizations, held at Universidad Autónoma de Manizales, Colombia. The platform was showcased alongside institutions such as UAM, EAN, Tecnológico de Monterrey, and SENA’s Coffee Training Center. This space allowed the team to present the project’s core functionalities, gather feedback from academic and environmental leaders, and explore potential collaborations to support the platform’s growth.
              </p>
              <p class="pb-0 mb-0">The website remains in development, with new features being integrated and ongoing design improvements based on real feedback. The goal is to scale the platform while maintaining a human-centered design approach that supports both students and environmental organizations.
